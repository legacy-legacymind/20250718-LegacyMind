# Redis Bloom Filter Implementation Update

## Overview
Updated the bloom filter implementation in UnifiedThink to use native Redis 8.0 bloom filter commands instead of a HashSet-based approach.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed HashSet Import
- Removed `use std::collections::HashSet;` from `src/redis.rs`

### 2. Updated `init_bloom_filter()` Method
- Now uses `BF.RESERVE` command with:
  - 0.01 (1%) false positive rate
  - 100,000 expected items capacity
- Added proper error handling for when RedisBloom module is not available
- Detects if filter already exists

### 3. Updated `is_duplicate_thought()` Method
- Uses `BF.EXISTS` command to check for thought existence
- Returns proper boolean based on bloom filter response
- Gracefully handles missing bloom filter module

### 4. Updated `add_to_bloom_filter()` Method
- Uses `BF.ADD` command to add thought hashes
- Handles case where bloom filter doesn't exist by creating it first
- Provides debug logging for additions

### 5. Added `get_bloom_filter_info()` Method
- New method to retrieve bloom filter statistics using `BF.INFO`
- Useful for monitoring and debugging
- Returns JSON representation of filter information

## Benefits

1. **Memory Efficiency**: True probabilistic data structure vs storing all hashes
2. **Performance**: O(1) operations regardless of filter size
3. **Scalability**: Can handle millions of items with minimal memory
4. **Native Support**: Uses Redis's optimized C implementation

## Requirements

- Redis 8.0+ with RedisBloom module installed
- To install RedisBloom:
  ```bash
  # Using Redis Stack (includes RedisBloom)
  docker run -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack:latest
  
  # Or load module manually
  redis-server --loadmodule /path/to/redisbloom.so
  ```

## Error Handling

The implementation gracefully handles cases where:
- RedisBloom module is not installed (falls back to no duplicate detection)
- Bloom filter doesn't exist (creates it on demand)
- Redis connection issues (propagates errors appropriately)

## Testing

Use the provided `test_bloom_filter.py` script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_bloom_filter.py
```

## Notes

- SHA256 hashing is still used to create fixed-size identifiers for thoughts
- The 1% false positive rate means ~1 in 100 checks might incorrectly identify a new thought as duplicate
- The 100k capacity can be adjusted based on expected usage patterns

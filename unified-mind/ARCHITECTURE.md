# UnifiedMind Architecture Documentation

## Overview

UnifiedMind is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that provides semantic search capabilities across distributed thought collections stored in Qdrant vector database.

## Current Architecture

### Components

1. **MCP Server** (rmcp 0.3.0)
   - Handles tool registration and client communication
   - Provides `um_recall` tool for semantic search

2. **Vector Database** (Qdrant v1.12.1)
   - Stores thought vectors with 1536 dimensions
   - Uses OpenAI text-embedding-3-small embeddings
   - Collections: `{INSTANCE}_thoughts` and `{INSTANCE}_identity`
   - Currently has 688 indexed vectors in CC_thoughts

3. **Caching Layer** (Redis)
   - L1 cache for query results (1-hour TTL)
   - Thought metadata storage (usage counts, access patterns)
   - Connection pooling via deadpool-redis

4. **Embedding Generation**
   - OpenAI API for text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions)
   - Groq API integration exists but Groq doesn't provide embeddings

### Search Flow

1. Query received via `um_recall` tool
2. Check Redis cache for existing results
3. Generate embedding using OpenAI API
4. Search Qdrant collections using vector similarity
5. Apply weighted scoring:
   - Semantic similarity: 50%
   - Temporal relevance: 30% (exponential decay over 30 days)
   - Usage frequency: 20%
6. Cache results in Redis
7. Return ranked thoughts

## Fixed Issues (July 19, 2025)

### ✅ Search Now Returns Results
- **Root Cause**: Numeric point ID parsing and field mapping issues
- **Fix Applied**: Updated `point_to_thought` function to handle numeric point IDs by extracting `thought_id` from payload
- **Field Mapping**: Corrected `instance_id` → `instance` and `created_at` → `processed_at`
- **Status**: 688 thoughts now searchable, returns ~10 results per query with semantic scores 0.27-0.35

### ✅ Cost-Optimized Architecture Implemented
- **Groq Integration**: Query enhancement and result synthesis
- **Redis Caching**: 7-day TTL for embeddings, reduces OpenAI API costs
- **Smart Flow**: Query → Groq Enhancement → Cache Check → OpenAI Embedding → Qdrant Search → Groq Synthesis

## Current Operational Architecture

### 1. ✅ Working RAG Pipeline
- **Query Enhancement**: Groq expands queries with synonyms and related concepts
- **Embedding Cache**: Redis with 7-day TTL minimizes OpenAI API costs
- **Vector Search**: Qdrant with Cosine similarity on 1536-dimensional vectors
- **Result Synthesis**: Groq generates comprehensive answers from search results

### 2. ✅ Performance Optimizations
- **Cost Control**: Aggressive caching reduces OpenAI API calls
- **Smart Scoring**: Combines semantic (50%), temporal (30%), and usage (20%) scores
- **Federation Search**: Cross-instance search capabilities
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive tracing for troubleshooting

### 3. ✅ Technical Stack Validation
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (confirmed working)
- **Search Engine**: Qdrant with default vector configuration
- **Caching**: Redis with connection pooling
- **Framework**: rmcp 0.3.0 MCP implementation

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Local Embedding Model Integration
- Implement sentence-transformers for cost-free default search
- Keep OpenAI as optional high-quality tier
- Dual embedding strategy with model selection

### 2. Advanced Features
- Real-time thought indexing
- Faceted search and filtering
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Cost tracking and budgeting

### 3. Federation Improvements
- Cross-instance thought sharing
- Distributed search coordination
- Identity synchronization

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # For embedding generation
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...           # For query enhancement and synthesis
REDIS_PASSWORD=...              # Redis authentication

# Optional
REDIS_HOST=localhost            # Redis server host
REDIS_PORT=6379                 # Redis server port
QDRANT_HOST=localhost           # Qdrant server host
QDRANT_PORT=6334                # Qdrant server port
INSTANCE_ID=CC                  # Instance identifier
```

## Federation Model

UnifiedMind supports searching across multiple instances:
- CC (Claude Code)
- DT (Desktop)
- CCS (Claude Code Studio)
- CCB (Claude Code Brain)

Each instance has separate collections for thoughts and identity.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Query Processing**: ~400-500ms per search (including enhancement)
- **Embedding Generation**: ~300ms (OpenAI API, cached for 7 days)
- **Vector Search**: <100ms for 688 thought collection
- **Cache Hit**: <10ms (Redis lookup)
- **Result Synthesis**: ~200ms (Groq generation)
- **Weighted Scoring**: ~50ms per 100 results

## Operational Status

✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - UnifiedMind RAG system is fully operational as of July 19, 2025:

- ✅ 688 thoughts indexed and searchable
- ✅ Semantic scores ranging 0.27-0.35 
- ✅ Cost-optimized architecture implemented
- ✅ Federation search across multiple instances
- ✅ Comprehensive debugging and logging
- ✅ Redis caching operational
- ✅ Groq integration for enhancement and synthesis

The system successfully resolves the original 0-results issue and provides robust semantic search capabilities across the LegacyMind Federation.

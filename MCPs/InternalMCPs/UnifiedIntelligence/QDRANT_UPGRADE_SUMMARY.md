# Qdrant Client Upgrade Summary

**Date**: July 3, 2025  
**Upgrade**: Qdrant client from 1.11.0 to 1.14.1  
**Status**: ✅ Completed Successfully

## Changes Made

### 1. Package.json Update
- Updated `@qdrant/js-client-rest` dependency from `1.11.0` to `1.14.1`
- Package installation completed successfully with no conflicts

### 2. API Compatibility Changes
- **Health Monitor Update**: Replaced deprecated `getClusterInfo()` with `versionInfo()` method
  - File: `src/core/health-monitor.js`
  - Change ensures compatibility with Qdrant 1.14.1 API
  - Health checks now use version info instead of cluster status

### 3. Core Operations Verified
All essential Qdrant operations remain fully compatible:
- ✅ `getCollections()` - Collection management
- ✅ `createCollection()` - Collection creation
- ✅ `upsert()` - Document insertion/updates
- ✅ `search()` - Vector similarity search
- ✅ `scroll()` - Batch retrieval
- ✅ `delete()` - Point deletion

### 4. Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Updated dependency version
2. `src/core/health-monitor.js` - API method update
3. `README.md` - Added version history documentation

## Verification Results

- ✅ Package installs without errors
- ✅ QdrantClient instantiation successful
- ✅ All required API methods available
- ✅ Health monitor compatibility verified
- ✅ No breaking changes detected

## Impact Assessment

**Low Risk**: This is a minor version upgrade with minimal API changes.

- **Persistence Layer**: No changes required - all core vector operations work identically
- **Rollback Coordinator**: No changes required - delete operations unchanged
- **Health Monitoring**: Minor update completed to use new API method
- **Configuration**: No changes required - connection parameters unchanged

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback can be performed by:
1. Reverting `package.json` to version `1.11.0`
2. Running `npm install`
3. Reverting `health-monitor.js` to use `getClusterInfo()`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Health Check**: Verify health monitor returns valid Qdrant status
2. **Vector Operations**: Test thought persistence and retrieval
3. **Search Functionality**: Verify similarity search works correctly
4. **Collection Management**: Ensure collection operations function properly

## Dependencies

This upgrade aligns with the Qdrant database upgrade performed by CCD team and resolves version compatibility warnings in the GMCP output.

# UnifiedIntelligence Redis-Only Rebuild

## Summary
This is the 6th rebuild of UnifiedIntelligence, stripped down to **Redis-only writes** as specifically requested by Sam. All PostgreSQL and Qdrant operations have been removed.

## What Was Removed
- **ALL PostgreSQL dependencies and operations**
- **ALL Qdrant dependencies and operations** 
- **ALL reading functions** (context injection, pattern analysis, similar thoughts)
- **ALL database managers except Redis**
- **ALL analysis beyond writing the thought**
- **ALL patterns, vector search, and similarity operations**

## What Remains
- **Capture thoughts to Redis** - Core functionality
- **Auto-capture to Redis** - Basic session management
- **Remember to Redis** - Simple thought storage
- **Context management to Redis** - Minimal federation support
- **Mode detection** - Kept for basic thought categorization

## Core Files (4 total)
1. `src/index.js` - MCP server with Redis-only config
2. `src/core/unified-intelligence.js` - Main logic, Redis-only writes
3. `src/core/session-manager.js` - Minimal in-memory session management
4. `src/core/mode-detector.js` - Basic mode detection (unchanged)

## Dependencies Cleaned Up
**Before:** 5 dependencies (including pg, @qdrant/js-client-rest)
**After:** 3 dependencies (ioredis, uuid, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk)

## Key Features
- **Simple**: ui_think captures a thought and writes it to Redis. Period.
- **Fast**: No complex analysis, no database queries, no vector operations
- **Reliable**: Direct Redis operations with basic error handling
- **Minimal**: Only the essential functionality Sam requested

## Actions Available
- `capture`: Process thoughts and save to Redis
- `status`: Get current session status  
- `check_in`: Initialize federation for instance
- `help`: Get usage information

## Philosophy
"Keep it simple" - Just capture thoughts to Redis, nothing else.

## Build Status
✅ All unnecessary files removed
✅ Dependencies cleaned up (removed 19 packages)
✅ Syntax checks passed
✅ Ready for deployment

This version focuses exclusively on what Sam asked for: Redis writes only, no complexity, no additional features.

# UnifiedIntelligence v3 Implementation Worklog
## Date: 2025-01-07 14:33 CDT

### Completed Phases (1-5)

#### Phase 0: Environment Preparation ✓
- Verified Redis 8.0 container running with all required modules:
  - ReJSON
  - RediSearch  
  - RedisTimeSeries
  - RedisBloom
- Created project structure and package.json

#### Phase 1: Core Analyzers ✓
- Implemented 4 analyzers:
  - **ModeAnalyzer**: Classifies operational modes (debug, design, execute, reflect, question, explore)
  - **SignificanceAnalyzer**: Evaluates importance (1-10 scale) with confidence scoring
  - **TagAnalyzer**: Extracts tags from content, entities, and implicit patterns
  - **FrameworkAnalyzer**: Suggests applicable thinking frameworks based on content
- Created AnalyzerOrchestrator to coordinate all analyzers

#### Phase 2: Framework Engine ✓
- Copied existing frameworks from v2_components:
  - First Principles Thinking
  - Six Thinking Hats
  - SWOT Analysis
- Built FrameworkEngine with:
  - Framework registration system
  - Interactive step-by-step execution
  - Session management for active frameworks
  - Quick apply for non-interactive use

#### Phase 3: Redis-Native Storage Layer ✓
- Implemented Redis 8.0 enhanced components:
  - **RedisManager**: Singleton connection manager with module verification
  - **ThoughtRecorder**: 
    - Bloom filter deduplication
    - RedisJSON document storage
    - Stream-based thought recording
    - Time series metrics
    - Full-text search with RediSearch
  - **SessionManager**:
    - Session lifecycle management
    - Time series metrics per session
    - Atomic operations with Lua scripts
  - **FederationHandler**:
    - Consumer groups for reliable message delivery
    - Stream-based federation communication

#### Phase 4: Memory Formation Pipeline ✓
- Built the core processing pipeline:
  - Thought analysis and storage
  - Pattern detection (mode, significance, tags, timing)
  - Auto-framework application
  - Event publishing
  - Metrics tracking
  - Result caching

#### Phase 5: Server and Handlers ✓
- Implemented 5 MCP tools:
  - **ui_think**: Primary thought capture and analysis
  - **ui_search**: Full-text search with filters
  - **ui_session**: Session management (create, current, end, metrics)
  - **ui_framework**: Interactive framework application
  - **ui_check_in**: Quick status updates
- Created main MCP server with:
  - Proper initialization sequence
  - Dependency injection
  - Error handling
  - Graceful shutdown

### Redis 8.0 Features Integrated
1. **RediSearch**: Full-text indexing on thoughts and contexts
2. **RedisTimeSeries**: Metrics tracking with aggregations
3. **RedisBloom**: Efficient duplicate detection
4. **Stream Consumer Groups**: Reliable federation messaging
5. **RedisJSON**: Native JSON document storage with indexing

### Current Status
- Core functionality implemented (Phases 0-5)
- System ready for testing with CCMCP
- All Redis 8.0 features integrated

### Path Forward
Remaining phases to implement:
- Phase 6: Auto-Capture Monitor
- Phase 7: PM2 Productionization
- Phase 8: Federation Support (enhanced)
- Phase 9: Expert Knowledge Integration

### Testing Plan
1. Install npm dependencies
2. Test connection to Redis
3. Use CCMCP to test each tool
4. Verify Redis 8.0 features working correctly
5. Check metrics and search functionality

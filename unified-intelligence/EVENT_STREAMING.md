# Event Streaming Implementation

## Overview
Event streaming has been successfully implemented for the unified-think system to provide a complete audit trail of all operations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Event Stream Methods in `redis.rs`
- `init_event_stream()` - Initializes a Redis Stream for an instance with MAXLEN ~10000
- `log_event()` - Generic event logging method
- `log_thought_event()` - Specialized method for thought-related events

### 2. Event Logging Points in `repository.rs`
- **thought_created** - Logged when a thought is successfully saved
  - Includes: thought_id, chain_id, thought_preview, thought_number
- **thought_accessed** - Logged when a thought is retrieved
  - Includes: thought_id, chain_id
- **chain_created** - Logged when a new chain is created
  - Includes: chain_id, thought_count, created_at
- **chain_updated** - Logged when an existing chain is updated
  - Includes: chain_id, thought_count, created_at

### 3. Stream Key Format
- `stream:{instance}:events` - Where {instance} is the instance ID

### 4. Event Structure
Each event contains:
- `event_type` - The type of event
- `instance` - The instance ID
- `timestamp` - RFC3339 formatted timestamp
- Additional fields specific to the event type

## Usage
The event stream is automatically initialized when the service starts. All events are logged asynchronously and failures are non-fatal to ensure system stability.

## Testing
To view events in Redis:
```bash
# List all event streams
redis-cli KEYS "stream:*:events"

# Read events from a specific stream
redis-cli XREAD COUNT 10 STREAMS "stream:{instance}:events" 0

# Read latest events in reverse order
redis-cli XREVRANGE "stream:{instance}:events" + - COUNT 10
```

## Notes
- Events are automatically trimmed to approximately 10,000 entries per stream
- All event logging is non-blocking and failures don't affect main operations
- The implementation provides a complete audit trail for compliance and debugging

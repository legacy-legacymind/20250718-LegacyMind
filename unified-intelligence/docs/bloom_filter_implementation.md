# Bloom Filter Implementation for Duplicate Detection

## Overview
This implementation adds duplicate detection functionality to the unified-think service using a hash-based approach that simulates Bloom filter behavior.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Data Structure**
- Uses a `HashSet<String>` to store SHA-256 hashes of thought content
- Stored in Redis with key format: `bloom:{instance}:thoughts`
- Provides deterministic duplicate detection (unlike probabilistic Bloom filters)

### 2. **Key Methods**

#### `init_bloom_filter(instance: &str)`
- Initializes an empty hash set for the given instance
- Checks if filter already exists before creating
- Called automatically when service starts for each instance

#### `is_duplicate_thought(instance: &str, thought_content: &str)`
- Hashes the thought content using SHA-256
- Checks if hash exists in the stored set
- Returns `true` if potential duplicate found

#### `add_to_bloom_filter(instance: &str, thought_content: &str)`
- Hashes the thought content using SHA-256
- Adds hash to the set after successful thought save
- Warns if set grows beyond 100,000 entries

### 3. **Integration with Save Flow**
The duplicate detection is integrated into the `save_thought` method in `repository.rs`:

1. **Check Phase**: Before saving, checks if thought is duplicate
2. **Log Phase**: If duplicate detected, logs warning but continues
3. **Save Phase**: Saves the thought normally
4. **Update Phase**: After successful save, adds hash to filter

### 4. **Hash Function**
- Uses SHA-256 for consistent, cryptographically secure hashing
- Hash format: lowercase hexadecimal string
- Example: `"e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"`

## Design Decisions

### Why HashSet Instead of True Bloom Filter?
1. **Simplicity**: No need for complex bit array operations
2. **Persistence**: Easy serialization with serde_json
3. **Debugging**: Can inspect actual hashes if needed
4. **No False Negatives**: Guaranteed accurate duplicate detection

### Trade-offs
- **Memory Usage**: Higher than true Bloom filter (stores full hashes)
- **Performance**: O(1) lookups but larger serialization overhead
- **Scalability**: Works well up to ~100K thoughts per instance

## Production Considerations

For production with millions of thoughts, consider:
1. Implementing a true Bloom filter with bit arrays
2. Using Redis Bloom module (RedisBloom)
3. Periodic cleanup of old hashes
4. Separate Bloom filters by time windows

## Testing

Use the provided `test_bloom_filter.py` script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_bloom_filter.py
```

The test script:
1. Saves an initial thought
2. Saves the same thought again (triggers duplicate detection)
3. Saves a different thought (no duplicate detection)
4. Recalls all thoughts to verify storage
